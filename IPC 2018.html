                            This is the website for the temporal tracks of the
                            IPC 2018. This is the 7th IPC containing
                            classical tracks, since the specification
                            of PDDL 2.1 in 2002.  In addition to the temporal
                            tracks, the IPC also has classical and
                            probabilistic tracks. You can find
                            information about them on <a href="https://ipc2018.bitbucket.io/">

                            There are two temporal tracks: 'satisficing'
                            and 'on board'.  The tracks differ in the amount
                            of resources available.  The evaluation
                            criterion is plan quality within the time available.
                            We encourage participants to enter
                            their planner in both tracks.

                            IPC 2018 will use a subset of PDDL 2.2, as
                            in previous years.  Planners must support the subset of the
                            language involving STRIPS, durative actions and action costs.
                            Some domains will additionally require Timed Initial Literals,
                            and numeric state variables. We will
                            consider providing alternative domain

                        <p>
                            As in previous editions, the competitors
                            must submit the source code of their
                            planners that will be run by the organizers
                            on the actual competition domains/problems,
                            unknown to the competitors until this time.
                            This way no fine-tuning of the planners
                            will be possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All competitors must submit an abstract
                            (max. 300 words) and a 4-page paper
                            describing their planners. After the
                            competition we encourage the participants
                            to analyze the results of their planner and
                            submit an extended version of their
                            abstract. An important requirement for IPC
                            2018 competitors is to give the organizers
                            the right to post their paper and the
                            source code of their planners on the
                            official IPC 2018 web site.

                            Up to two versions of the same planner are allowed to
                            participate. To submit two different versions of the same
                            planner, simply create two different repositories.

                            In each branch, add a file called
                            Singularity to the root directory of your
                            repository. This file is used to bootstrap
                            a singularity container and to run the
                            planner (an <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-temporal/demo-submission/src/ipc-2018-temp-sat/Singularity?at=ipc-2018-temp-sat" target="_blank"> example</a> can be found
                            in our demo submission. For more details on
                            Singularity <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/#singularity">see

                            We will build all planners once a day and
                            run them on a number of test cases. You can
                            see the results for your planner on the <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/build-status.html" target="_blank">
                            build status page</a>. Test your
                            Singularity file locally (see below) and
                            make sure it passes our automated tests.

                            A planner is officially registered in a
                            track if it has a green box for that track
                            on the <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/build-status.html" target="_blank">build status page</a> on
                            March 18. You can still make any code
                            changes you want until April 10. The
                            build status on the website will update
                            (once a day) when you push new changes the
                            registered branches.

                        <h3>Bug fixing policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            We will fork your repository on February
                            20. If you find any bugs in your code
                            afterwards (or if we detect any while
                            running your code), you can create a pull
                            request to our fork with a patch fixing the
                            bug. Only bug fixes will be accepted after
                            the deadline (in particular, we will not
                            accept patches modifying behavior or tuning
                            parameters).

                        <p>
                                In an effort to increase reproducibility and
                                reduce the effort of running future IPCs, we
                                are using software containers that contain the
                                submitted planner and everything required to
                                run it. We are using <a href="http://singularity.lbl.gov/" target="_blank">
                                Singularity</a> which is an alternative to the
                                well-known Docker. Singularity (in contrast to
                                Docker) is specifically designed for scientific
                                experiments on HPC clusters and has low
                                overhead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Singularity containers can be viewed as
                                light-weight alternatives to virtual machines
                                that carry a program and all parts of the OS
                                that are necessary to run it. They can be based
                                on any docker image. We created an <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-temporal/demo-submission" target="_blank"> example submission</a> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-temporal/demo-submission/src/ipc-2018-seq-opt/Singularity?at=ipc-2018-seq-opt" target="_blank"> Singularity file</a>) that
                                uses the latest Ubuntu as a basis and uses
                                apt-get to install required packages for Fast
                                Downward. It then builds the planner from the
                                files that are next to the Singularity file in
                                the repository.

                                frequently asked questions about Singularity.
                                We'll update this section as we get more
                                questions. If you run into problems using
                                Singularity and your problem is not answered

                                                the container during the competition: the
                                                parameter "-H" mounts the directory containing
                                                the PDDL files into the file system of the
                                                container and uses it as the user's home
                                                directory. The parameter "-C" then isolates the
                                                container from the rest of the system. Only
                                                files written to the mounted directory will be
                                                stored permanently. Other created files (for
                                                example in /tmp) only persist for the current
                                                session and are cleaned up afterwards. When
                                                running the container on two instances at the
                                                same time, their run directories and sessions
                                                will be different, so the two runs cannot
                                                interact. The container itself is read-only
                                                after its creation.

                                        the container which is also the directory that contains
                                        the input files. You have write access to this
                                        directory and files written here will be persistent.
                                        However, the home directory will be different in each
                                        run, so each run will start from the same clean
                                        container. You also have write access to the directory
                                        <pre><code>/tmp</code></pre> but files written there
                                        will be deleted after the run. See the question above
                                        for how to set up Singularity in this way for testing.

                                        It is not necessary to reduce the image size as much as

                              most common kind of planners: portfolios and
                              heuristic search planners (based on Fast Downward).
                              However, this list is not closed. If your planner
                              reports other useful statistics, or they are in a
                              different format, we would like to parse them as

                              of the information that your planner provides in
                              the logs and, if possible, a Python regular
                              expression that parses it.

                            The source code of all entries is publicly available on bitbucket.
                            To build the planners, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/#singularityfaq">FAQ</a>.
                            Note that some planners require the LP solver CPLEX to compile.
                            To build such a planner, acquire a CPLEX license, download the installation files
                            to the directory <code>/third-party</code> or change that path in the Singularity file.
                            Since building a singularity image requires root privileges, we recommend building the
                            image inside a virtual machine. For example, you may use vagrant
                            <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> with this
                            <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/misc/Vagrantfile" download="">Vagrantfile</a>. It expects a directory <code>./input</code>
                            where the planner is located and an empty directory <code>./output</code> where the image
                            will be created.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some planners had minor bug fixes after the
                            competition. We have updated the last version of each planner.

                            of this talk contain additional detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An <a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/scores.html">overview of the
                            scores</a> is available online.
                            Detailed results for all planners are
                            available in two forms: a small repository
                            per track contains an HTML table and a JSON
                            file containing the parsed values for all
                            instances
                            (satisficing track, on-board planning track).
                            
                            If you require more detail about individual
                            planner runs, the raw logs of all runs
                            including all meta data generated by our
                            scripts is available as well:
                            </p><ul>
                                <li><a href="https://ipc2018-temporal.bitbucket.io/results/temporal-satisficing-logs.tar.bz2" download="">satisficing track</a> (31 MB unpacks to 531 MB),</li>
                            </ul>
                            Even more detailed data that includes files generated by the planner during
                            runtime are available on request.
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Based on these results, we are proudly presenting the following awards.</p>
